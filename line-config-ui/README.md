# line-config-ui
This package contains Blaze configuration UI templates for Line OAuth.

Also, this package contains the CSS classes to set the button interface just like LINE specs. To do so, please download the images from [here](https://developers.line.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/LINE_Login_Button_Image.zip), and paste them into the public folder in your repo, and then create a button with this id ```line-login-button ```
